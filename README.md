# QCGPU

> An Open Source, High Performance & Hardware Accelerated, Quantum Computer Simulator in Rust

* Uses OpenCL kernels.
* Runs Cross Platform.

## Prerequisites:
* OpenCL (Ensure that an OpenCL library is installed for your platform and that `clinfo` or some other diagnostic command will run). 
* Rust (install [here](https://www.rustup.rs)). Please use a nightly build.


## Notes

A stretch goal for this project is to also (optionally) simulate decoherence, to allow
for more realistic simulations.
